ex 4-6- The git reflog command is used for Git to record updates made to the tip of branches. It allows to return to commits even to the ones that are not referenced by any branch or any tag. After rewriting history, the reflog includes information about the previous state of branches and makes it possible to go back to that state if needed
7-git revert is used to undo a previous commit. In git, you can't alter or erase an earlier commit. (Actually you can, but it can cause problems.) So instead of editing the earlier commit, revert introduces a new commit that reverses an earlier one. git reset is used to undo changes in your working directory that haven't been comitted yet
